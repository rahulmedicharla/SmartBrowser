If applicable also give examples that can help solidify the concept, and possible practice questions, again if applicable. Do not give answers that don't relate to my question. I would like your output to be a JSON object. The first key in the object will be the 'response' key which is a string that is your entire response to the question, given in HTML format. The second key in the object is the 'links' key which is an array of HTML anchor tags that have at max three links that relate to the question and help solidify the concept. Make sure your explanation is in lay mans, can be understandable by a high schooler, and provide easy to understand examples. ONLY give me a json object with USE HTML TO EMBEDD LINKS AND TEXT.

Question: How does a JK flip-flop work. { \"response\": \"<p><b>JK-FlipFlops</b> <br><br> A <b>JK flip-flop</b> is a type of digital circuit that stores a single bit of information. It has two inputs, <b>J</b> (set) and <b>K</b> (reset), and two outputs, <b>Q</b> and <b>QÌ…</b> (Q complement). When the J and K inputs are both low, the flip-flop remains in its previous state. When J is high and K is low, the flip-flop changes its state to high (Q=1). When K is high and J is low, the flip-flop changes its state to low (Q=0). When both J and K are high, the flip-flop toggles between its two states, which means that it switches from high to low or from low to high. <br><br>For example, suppose we start with the flip-flop in the reset state (Q=0). If we set J=1 and K=0, the flip-flop changes its state to high (Q=1). If we then set J=0 and K=1, the flip-flop changes its state to low (Q=0). If we now set J=1 and K=1, the flip-flop toggles its state and becomes high (Q=1) again. <br><br>The JK flip-flop is widely used in digital electronics, particularly in computer memory and microprocessors.</p>\", \"links\": \"[<a href=\"https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/sequential/seq_4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sequential Circuits</a>, <a href= \"https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/logic_digital/jk-flip-flop-tutorial-basics.php\" target=\"_blank\">Jk Flip Flop Tutorial</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1OC5e7Tn_o\" target=\"_blank\">JK Flip Flop Video</a>]\"}. Question 2: What is the difference between Mitosis and Meiosis. {\"response\": \"<p><b>Mitosis vs. Meiosis</b> <br><br> Mitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division that occur in eukaryotic cells. Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in the formation of two genetically identical daughter cells, each having the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Meiosis is the process of cell division that results in the formation of four genetically diverse daughter cells, each having half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. <br><br> The main differences between mitosis and meiosis are: </p><ul><li>Mitosis occurs in somatic cells, while meiosis occurs in germ cells</li><li>Mitosis results in two daughter cells, while meiosis results in four daughter cells</li><li>Mitosis produces genetically identical daughter cells, while meiosis produces genetically diverse daughter cells</li><li>Mitosis involves one round of cell division, while meiosis involves two rounds of cell division</li><li>Mitosis maintains the same number of chromosomes in daughter cells as in parent cells, while meiosis reduces the number of chromosomes in daughter cells by half</li></ul>\", \"links\": [\"< a href = \"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/cellular-molecular-biology/stem-cells-and-cancer/a/mitosis-overview\" target=\"_blank\"> Mitosis Overview < /a>,<a href=\"https:/ / www.khanacademy.org / science / biology / classical - genetics / meiosis / a / intro - to - meiosis \" target=\"_blank\">Meiosis Overview</a>,<a href=\"https: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijj58pjIWjo\" target=\"_blank\">Mitosis vs Meiosis Video</a>\"]} Remember, only provide what I asked for."
